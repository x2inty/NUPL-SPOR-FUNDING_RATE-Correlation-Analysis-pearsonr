In Progress: 

Combining multiple variables such as Funding Rate, NUPL, and SOPR makes the analysis complex due to the interactions between them. Multiple thresholds can limit the number of valid signals, making it difficult to identify significant correlations. P-values close to 1 or extreme correlations may indicate that the results are skewed by overly specific or noisy data.

To improve the analysis:

Use techniques like PCA to simplify the analysis and reduce noise.

Test different threshold combinations to find the most relevant ones.

Use more complex models: Explore models like multivariate regression or machine learning to better handle complex interactions between variables.

Relax strict conditions to generate more valid signals.

Test different combinations of variables: This will help to better understand how the variables interact and affect the results.

In summary, while the analysis becomes more complex as more variables are added, methodological adjustments and more sophisticated approaches can improve the accuracy and robustness of the results.
